# ADR-003: Firebase JWT Authentication Integration

**Status**: In Progress  
**Date**: 2024-10-17  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

The Basketball AI Ecosystem requires secure authentication to protect user data and API endpoints. We need to implement Firebase Authentication with JWT token validation on the backend and authentication flows on the mobile app.

## Decision

We will implement Firebase Authentication using:

### Backend (Fastify)
- **Firebase Admin SDK** for JWT token verification
- **JWT validation middleware** for protected routes
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with user roles (free, premium, admin)
- **User session management** with token refresh capabilities

### Mobile (React Native/Expo)
- **Firebase Auth SDK** for user authentication flows
- **JWT token storage** in secure storage
- **Authentication context** with React Context API
- **Protected route navigation** based on auth state

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens validated on every protected request
- Refresh token rotation for security
- Secure token storage on mobile (Expo SecureStore)
- Role-based endpoint protection
- Request rate limiting by user

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend JWT Middleware
1. Install Firebase Admin SDK
2. Configure Firebase Admin with service account
3. Create JWT validation middleware
4. Add role-based access control
5. Protect health endpoint as example
6. Add auth error handling

### Phase 2: Mobile Auth Integration
1. Install Firebase Auth SDK
2. Create authentication context
3. Implement sign in/sign up flows
4. Add secure token storage
5. Configure authenticated HTTP client
6. Add auth state persistence

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. End-to-end auth flow tests
2. JWT token validation tests
3. Role-based access tests
4. Mobile auth state tests

## Consequences

### Positive
- Industry-standard authentication system
- Scalable user management
- Built-in security features (token expiration, refresh)
- Role-based access control ready for premium features
- Mobile-first authentication experience

### Negative
- Additional dependency on Firebase services
- Increased complexity in request flow
- Need to handle token refresh scenarios
- Mobile secure storage dependencies

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=basketball-ai-ecosystem
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=...
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

### JWT Middleware Flow
1. Extract `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
2. Verify JWT with Firebase Admin SDK
3. Extract user ID and roles from token claims
4. Attach user info to request context
5. Continue to route handler or return 401/403

### Mobile Auth Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. Firebase Auth validates and returns JWT
3. Store JWT securely on device
4. Include JWT in all API requests
5. Handle token refresh automatically
6. Clear tokens on logout

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Backend validates Firebase JWT tokens
- [ ] Protected routes require valid authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control works (free/premium/admin)
- [ ] Mobile app authenticates users successfully
- [ ] JWT tokens stored securely on mobile
- [ ] Auth state persists across app restarts
- [ ] Error handling for expired/invalid tokens
- [ ] Integration tests pass
