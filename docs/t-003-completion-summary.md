## Authentication Flow Verification
1. ✅ User signs up with email/password
2. ✅ Email verification sent
3. ✅ User signs in after verification
4. ✅ JWT token stored securely on device
5. ✅ API calls include Bearer token automatically
6. ✅ Backend validates JWT and extracts user info
7. ✅ Role-based access control enforced
8. ✅ Token refresh works seamlessly
9. ✅ Sign out clears all stored tokens

## Files Created/Modified
- **Backend**: Firebase service, auth middleware, user routes, tests
- **Mobile**: Firebase config, auth context, screens, HTTP client, tests
- **Docs**: ADR-003, environment examples, implementation guides

## Ready for Next Phase
**T-004: Postgres Schema v1** - Database integration to persist user data, training records, and AI analysis results.

The authentication foundation is now solid and production-ready, enabling secure user management for the Basketball AI Ecosystem MVP.
